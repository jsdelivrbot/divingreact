# Blog Post Application

Blog post application main focus is creation, listing and rendering of blog posts.

Core learning undertaken with this application is focusing on complex routing within 
application and handling many other RESTful behaviour using React-Redux eco-system 
interactions.

### Planned for later

Currently using the udemy course hosted RESTful backed for CRUD work around but planning
for implementing in-house **backend** using Vert.x and hooking the Vert.x events on client-side 
Redux middleware this would be E2E event driven application and it will be real fun :)
